### From Portland to Portland

This fully responsive website describes the epic bicycle journey from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon. I built it to cement my understanding of responsive web design using HTML, CSS, and Block Elements Modifier ([BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/)) Methodology. It was fun to see how much could be done with just HTML and CSS without the use of CSS frameworks or libraries.

#### Learnings and Challenges

My main challenge on the project was figuring out how to name classes based on BEM Methodology. I had to read the documentation and refactor the class names several times until I was satisfied with the names. I also got to use HTML tags like `figure` and `figcaption`, which I had not had the opportunity of using before.

With my experience building this project, I believe the BEM Methodology helps standardize class names. But I do not think I would use the BEM methodology often as it takes a long time to set up. Though after the initial setup is done, it is easy to update the styles of any element without affecting other elements as against using HTML tags.
