### Trivia App

This full-stack responsive web app allows users to add and delete questions and play a mini quiz. I built it to review my understanding of RESTful API service. This is also the second project I completed as part of my Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. As a full-stack application, it consists of both the frontend and backend.

#### Frontend
The technologies used for the frontend were React, jQuery and CSS. As most of the logic for rendering the pages had been implemented, I decided to improve upon it by:

1. Changing the tags for most elements to appropriate semantic tags, such as replacing the button elements with `button` tags, the list elements, and its items respectively with `ul` and `li` tags, and using `section`, `article` and `details` tags where appropriate
2. Making the background colour of the navigation link of a page a shade of purple when a user navigates to the page for a better user experience
3. Making the pages responsive for most screen sizes
4. Adding a Popup Component to show up whenever an error occurs

#### Backend  
The technologies used for the backend were Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL. The primary features of the application are listed below:

1.	Displaying questions and answers to a user on the home page in paginated form
2.	Filtering questions by categories 
3.	Searching for questions using the search bar
4.	Creating new questions
5.	Deleting questions
6.	Playing the quiz

For each page to work as expected, I created 7 endpoints:

1.	To get all questions with a page query to get a list of paginated questions in groups of 10
2.	To create a new question
3.	To delete a question
4.	To get all categories
5.	To get a filtered list of questions using the inputted text in the search bar as a filter
6.	To get a list of paginated questions per category in groups of 10
7.	To get a random list of questions either based on one category or all categories

#### The logic for the Quiz Page
To play the quiz, a user must navigate to the quiz page and select a category; afterwards, a max of 5 questions is displayed in turns, and the user’s final score will be displayed on the screen. 
When a user selects a category, the quiz page makes an API request to the server with a request body that includes an array of the previously asked questions’ ids and the category the user selected. The request would look like this:


```
{
    "previous_questions": [18, 19], 
    "quiz_category": { "type": "Art", "id": "2"}
}
```

Whenever this request is sent, the function that is executed does the following:

1.	Gets all questions under the selected category from the database
2.	Saves an array of ids of questions of the selected category
3.	Checks if the number of previously asked questions is not equal to the number of questions under the selected category
4.	If no. 3 is equal; the next question is returned as an empty string in the response body
5.	If no. 3 is not equal; then, a random number is generated within the range of the minimum and maximum values of ids from the array of questions ids
6.	Checks if the number generated does not exist in the ids of previously asked questions
7.	If no. 6 exists, then step 5 is repeated until no. 6 does not exist
8.	If no. 6 does not exist, then the question with that id is fetched from the database and returned in the response body

The response to that request is a JSON object that includes the following question to be displayed. The response would look like this:


```
{
    "success": True,
    "question": {
        "answer": "Escher",
        "category": 2,
        "difficulty": 1,
        "id": 16,
        "question": "Which Dutch graphic artist–initials M C was a creator of optical illusions?"
    }
}
```

#### Learnings and Challenges
For the frontend aspect of this project, I got to use the HTML tags details and summary for the first time in a project. I used it to reveal and hide the answers to questions on the home page. It was more efficient than writing a function that controls when to show or hide the answer depending on if a button is clicked.

The most exciting part of the backend aspect was the quiz page. I translated the requirements into code, and the code worked as expected.
