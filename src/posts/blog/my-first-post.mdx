### Hello, World!

Hello everyone. I couldn't decided what to name my first post, **Hello, World!** seemed appropriate at the time. So for those wondering who I am you can check the [about](/about) page on the website.

So let's get down to it...

I am ***Full Stack Web Developer*** and I have been developing softwares or should I say working as one for over a year now (a year and 6 months to be specific). And if anything I have learnt is the need to document stuff - learning, solutions to interesting bugs, hacks for getting the most of certain developer tools. But honestly, I would say my major reason for the blog is to provide a online note for future me explaining how I solved something before and also improve my writing skills as you all would have noticed by now. I am a <s> terrible</s> work-in-progress writer. 

I will be writing based on tools and technologies I have used or want to use, weekend-projects and basic tips here and there about resume optimization and job search. Thanks for taking the time to read this. If you feel there is something in particular you want me to write about you can try reaching out on any of my social handles that might just encourage for me to write about it.
